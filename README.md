## BlinkLEDs 

- This folder includes programs that uses the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins to interact with multiple LED's
- This folder also includes programs that use the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins to interact with a simple push button
- Components required for the programs in this folder include 
  - 1 x Raspberry Pi 3 (I have used a 3, Model B. You can use whatever you have at your disposal.)
  - 3 x 50 Ohm Resistors
  - 3 x LED's
  - LED's connected to the following GPIO ports : led1 on GPIO17, led2 on GPIO27, led3 on GPIO22
  - 1 x Breadboard
  - 1 x Extension cable (Suggested) to extend the GPIO ports of the Raspberry Pi and bring them closed to the breadboard 
  - 6 x Jumper cables - Female (connect to Rasberry Pi GPIO) to Male (Connect to the Breadboard)
  - 1 x Tactile Push button
  - 1 x Raspberry Pi Cobbler board (Recommended, to breakout the GPIO's) and make working easier
